Tool to quickly deploy openstack dev environments

# Todo

* Add python-novaclient cli support
* move keystone/glance/dash to mysql
* syslog
* check openstack-puppet recipes to see if anything else is missing
* allow rabbit connection to be specified via environment variables with sensible defaults
* Add volume support
* allow changing of git locations (specify different tag/branch or repos)
* change method of invoking stack.sh to ./stack.sh all _or_ ./stack.sh nova-compute,nova-network,nova-api,nova-volume
* Add quantum support

# Done

* sqlconn can be set via env
* move back to using sudo
* move nova to mysql
* munin
* image upload with a script that supports generating images via debootstrap (ubuntu-vm-builder)

# Future

* idea: move from screen to tmux?
* idea: create a live-cd / vmware preview image using this?
* idea: use lxc to make the proto-image have everything?  so launching a new server is just turn on / updating / run?

OpenStack Dashboard
-------------------

The OpenStack Dashboard is a Django based reference implementation of a web
based management interface for OpenStack.

It is based on django-openstack, which is designed to be a generic Django
module that can be re-used in other sites.

For more information about how to get started with the OpenStack Dashboard,
view the README file in the openstack-dashboard folder.

For more information about working directly with django-openstack, see the
README file in the django-openstack folder.

For release management:

 * https://launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard

For blueprints and feature specifications:

 * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard

For issue tracking:

 * https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard

Project Structure and Testing:
------------------------------

This project is a bit different from other Openstack projects in that it has
two very distinct components underneath it: django-openstack, and
openstack-dashboard.

django-openstack holds the generic libraries and components that can be
used in any Django project. In testing, this component is set up with
buildout (see run_tests.sh), and any dependencies that get added need to
be added to the django-openstack/buildout.cfg file.

openstack-dashboard is a reference django project that uses django-openstack
and is built with a virtualenv and tested through that environment. If
depdendencies are added that the reference django project needs, they
should be added to openstack-dashboard/tools/pip-requires.

The run_tests.sh script invokes tests and analysis on both of these
components in it's process, and is what Jenkins uses to verify the
stability of the project.
